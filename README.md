## Overview

Third-generation Azure OpenAI voice bot with FastAPI, speech processing, and ACS WhatsApp event handling.

## Highlights

- Text conversation endpoint
- Speech-to-text and text-to-speech
- Conversational AI responses
- WhatsApp and ACS integration

## Tech Stack

Python · FastAPI · Azure OpenAI · LangChain · FAISS

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/haseebconventarian2-gif/voicebot-v3.git
cd voicebot-v3
python -m venv .venv
# Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

Configure Azure OpenAI deployments and any messaging-channel credentials in `.env`.

> Store credentials in `.env` and never commit secrets.

## Run

```bash
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

## Project Status

This is a learning and reference implementation. Review security, validation, monitoring, and deployment settings before production use.

## 🔄 Runtime Flow

`Text/audio → STT → retrieval → Azure chat → TTS/text → messaging channel`

This flow is derived from the current entry points and service calls.

## 🧪 Validation Guide

1. Install dependencies in a clean virtual environment.
2. Start the documented entry point and test the root or health route.
3. Exercise one valid and one invalid request.
4. Verify external-service errors are handled clearly.
5. Confirm secrets, private data, indexes, and model artifacts are ignored.

## 🔒 Production Checklist

- Use managed secret storage and rotate exposed credentials.
- Add authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and request-size limits.
- Add automated tests, structured logging, monitoring, and health checks.
- Pin and audit dependencies.
- Define retention and privacy controls for audio and customer data.

## ⚠️ Code-Audit Notes

- Documentation reflects the current repository code and may expose integrations that need separate cloud accounts, model assets, or channel approval.
- Treat the project as a reference implementation until its security and deployment configuration are hardened.
